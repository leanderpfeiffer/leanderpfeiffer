### Hello World, I’m Leander
 
I’m a Master student in mechanical engineering and aerospace in a double degree programm between the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and the Technical University of Munich.
My background is in mechanical engineering with a focus on automation and information systems. My Bachelors Thesis was about Semantic Web Technology in the context of Multi Agent Manufacturing.
Besides that, I also work doing Web-development, mostly in React.
